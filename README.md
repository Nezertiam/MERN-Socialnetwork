# About this project

This project was made by following step by step the Udemy's course about the MERN stack by Brad Traversy. The goal of this course is to create a social network like the linkedin for developers.

## Technologies used

MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node.js

## And what after ?

The last goal of this project is to refactor code to improve the structure, remove everything about this specific project and **keep the core of the MERN stack to reuse it for every future MERN project.** I also hope that this could help other who doesn't want to begin a new MERN project from scratch.
